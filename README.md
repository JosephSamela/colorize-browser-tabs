# Colorize Tabs
Since [Chrome 39](<https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android>) shipped with Android Lollipop in 2014 websites can use `theme-color` to customize the browser toolbar.
```
meta name="theme-color" content="#db5945">
```
Today many websites support `theme-color` and Chrome for Android looks ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Unfortunately `theme-color` still remains unsupported on the desktop - just light gray with favicons. Let's spice things up!

Boring tabs are gone with **Colorize Tabs** the extension that brings color to *your* favorite browser!

My goal is to support multiple browsers. 

| Browser | Status            | Link   |
| ------- |:-----------------:|--------|
| Firefox | v1.0              |        |
| Chrome  | under development |        |
| Edge    | not supported     |        |
| Safari  | not supported     |        |
| Opera   | not supported     |        |
