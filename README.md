# Colorize Tabs
Since Chrome 39 shipped with Android Lollipop in 2014 developers could customize color of the browser toolbar. [link](<https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android>)

Today many websites support `theme-color` and Chrome for Android looks ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Unfortunately `theme-color` still remains unsupported on the desktop. All major browsers look basically the same - light gray with favicons. Let's spice things up!

*Colorize Tabs* is a browser extension that brings color to your favorite browser!

My goal is to support multiple browsers. 

| Browser | Status            | Link   |
| ------- |:-----------------:|--------|
| Firefox | v1.0              |        |
| Chrome  | under development |        |
| Edge    | not supported     |        |
| Safari  | not supported     |        |
| Opera   | not supported     |        |
