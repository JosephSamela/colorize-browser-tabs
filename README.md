Since [Chrome 39](<https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android>) shipped with Android Lollipop in 2014 websites can use `theme-color` to customize the browser toolbar.

Today many websites support `theme-color` and Chrome for Android looks ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Unfortunately `theme-color` still remains unsupported on the desktop - just light gray with favicons.

Currently Firefox is the only browser with theme API support. [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/theme#Browser_compatibility)

So I can't build an extension for chrome...but I can switch to Firefox!
